üîó LangChain: Chat with Your Data
Overview

LangChain is a Python framework for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

It allows developers to chain together LLMs, prompts, tools, and data sources into workflows.

Ideal for chatbots, document analysis, knowledge retrieval, summarization, and data exploration.

Core Concepts

Chains

Sequences where the output of one step becomes the input of the next.

Types:

Simple Chain: User input ‚Üí LLM response

Multi-step Chain: Extract info ‚Üí summarize ‚Üí translate

Agents

AI programs that decide actions dynamically.

Example: Travel agent decides whether to query a flight API or hotel API.

Tools

External functions or APIs agents can call.

Examples: Search engines, calculators, databases, document readers.

Memory

Tracks past interactions to maintain context.

Short-term memory: Current session

Long-term memory: Persistent across sessions

Document Loaders

Pre-built connectors for data sources like PDF, CSV, HTML, JSON, SQL.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Combines external data retrieval with LLM responses.

Example: Searching a knowledge base to generate a concise answer.

Example Workflow

User asks: ‚ÄúShow last month‚Äôs sales trends.‚Äù

Chain extracts data from a CSV file.

LLM summarizes insights in bullet points.

Memory stores conversation context for follow-up queries.

Use Cases

Chatbots with contextual memory

Summarization of documents or reports

Knowledge retrieval from internal databases

API-based LLM automation tasks

‚úÖ Key Takeaways

LangChain is best for single-agent LLM applications.

RAG + Chains + Memory = context-aware, accurate AI responses.

Well-suited for linear workflows, document analysis, and data-driven applications.
