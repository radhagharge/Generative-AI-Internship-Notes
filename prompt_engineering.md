🎯 Goal

Learn to talk to AI (like ChatGPT or Gemini) for accurate, useful answers.

Craft smart, structured prompts for better AI performance.

🧩 1. What Is Prompt Engineering?

Prompts = Instructions you give to AI.

Better prompt → Better AI output

Example:

❌ Bad: “Tell me about AI.”

✅ Good: “Explain Artificial Intelligence in 3 bullet points for a 12-year-old.”

Key: Be specific, clear, and structured.

🧱 2. Structure of a Good Prompt

A strong prompt has 4 parts:

Instruction: What AI should do → "Summarize the paragraph below"

Context: Background or scenario → "You are a data analyst writing a report"

Input: Data/text to process → "Data shows a 15% rise in revenue..."

Output format: How AI should respond → "Give output as a bullet list"

Clear structure = more accurate, predictable results.

🔮 3. Types of Prompting Techniques

Zero-shot: No examples → "Translate this to French."

Few-shot: Provide examples → "Example: hello → bonjour. Now translate 'goodbye'."

Chain-of-thought: Step-by-step reasoning → "Explain your reasoning step by step."

Role prompting: Assign a role → "Act as a career counselor and suggest tech jobs for students."

Self-reflection: AI reviews its own answer → "Check your previous answer for any logical errors."

Use techniques to improve accuracy, reasoning, and creativity.

💡 4. Advanced Tips

Tone: "Write formally" / "Make it funny"

Limits: "In 100 words or less"

Combine prompts: "summarize → compare → explain"

Perfect for multi-step tasks or reports.

🧠 5. Common Prompt Patterns

Summarization: "Summarize this article in 3 bullet points."

Comparison: "Compare GPT and Gemini in a table."

Data extraction: "Extract all dates and names from this text."

Patterns make prompts reusable and efficient.

✅ Takeaway:
Prompt engineering = clarity + structure + guidance.

Treat AI as a smart, literal assistant.

Better prompts → better, faster, and reliable results.
